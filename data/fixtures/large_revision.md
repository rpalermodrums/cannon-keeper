# Draft Revision

## Scene 1

Mira crossed the stone bridge before dawn.
The lantern oil smelled like cedar and smoke.
She checked the brass compass three times and wrote the result in her notebook.
The first note said north, then north again, then north once more.

## Scene 2

Jonah waited in the archive hall with two sealed envelopes.
He spoke quietly so the scribes would not look up from their desks.
"If the council asks, we were never here," Jonah said.
Mira nodded and copied the map key onto fresh paper.

## Scene 3

Rain started at noon and did not stop until evening.
Water pooled against the iron gate and washed chalk marks from the steps.
Mira looked at Jonah and said, "The old route is gone."
Jonah replied, "Then we make a new route before nightfall."

## Scene 4

At dusk they reached the watchtower above the river bend.
The tower ledger listed three missing couriers and one damaged skiff.
Mira read every line twice and underlined the same three names.
Jonah folded the wet ledger page and tucked it into his coat.
