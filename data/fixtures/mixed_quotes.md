Mira paused at the market gate and counted six bells above the arch.

"I told you, the river rose last night," Jonah said, rubbing mud from his sleeves.

The baker laughed. "You always blame the river, Jonah."

Mira leaned closer to the spice cart and whispered, “The compass points north again.”

“North?” Jonah frowned. “It pointed east this morning.”

The bell rang once, and the crowd shifted toward the docks.
